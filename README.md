# Super Likers App - Test in Ionic

## Development server

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Wait a few seconds while the server starts automatically, that server is responsible for skipping the `cors` in the application.

## Install packages

Run `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.

## Build
Run `ionic build --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `www` directory.

To test the build you can do it using the Live Server extension of Visual Studio Code, enter the `www` path and click on Go Live
